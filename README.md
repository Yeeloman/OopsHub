Hello, this is **Yeeloman** speaking.

This repository serves one purpose: documenting our blunders—a reminder that, ultimately, struggle is what shapes us, driving humanity to strive for greater potential. It's the ongoing dance between 'I have no idea what I’m doing' and 'I am an unstoppable genius'. Shall we embrace the chaos together?

> [!NOTE]
> This project is clearly in its early stages, so I apologize in advance if the ideas feel scattered or cause any confusion. I welcome any feedback to help improve it.

So, with that out of the way, let's see how the project will be structured.
